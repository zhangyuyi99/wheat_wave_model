# Wheat Wave Model

The Wheat Wave Model project offers MATLAB Simulink models that represent various scenarios involving wheat. These models encompass a single wheat plant, a line of wheat plants, and a field of wheat. By adjusting the wind forces on the wheat, the project allows for the exploration of how wheat oscillates under different wind conditions (e.g., varying frequencies). A particular focus of the project is the study of the formation of metachronal waves in the presence of multiple wheat plants.

## Components

### Core Models
- **\`single_wheat.slx\`**: A model of a single wheat plant; other models use copies of this plant.
- **\`wheat_line.slx\`**: A model of a line of wheat plants.
- **\`wheat_field.slx\`**: A model representing a 10x10 wheat field.

### Wind Models
- **\`create_travelling_wind_rectangle.m\`**: Creates a traveling rectangular wave wind force with phase differences based on wheat positions.
- **\`create_travelling_wind_sine.m\`**: Similar to the above, but utilizes a sine wave for the wind force.
- **\`travelling_wind.slx\`**: Wind model created with sine waves.
- **\`travelling_wind_rectangle.slx\`**: Wind model created with rectangular waves.

### Analysis and Experiments
- **\`find_natural_freq.mlx\`**: Plots data to find the natural frequency with maximum oscillation.
- **\`natural_freq_experiment.m\`**: Determines the natural frequency of single wheat by observing oscillation under varying forces.
- **\`wheat_line_sway_analysis.mlx\`**: Analyzes the sway data generated by various models, such as \`wheat_line.slx\` and \`wheat_line_2_sine_wind.slx\`.
- **\`wheat_line_sway_travelling_wind_analysis.mlx\`**: Analyzes data generated by \`wheat_line_20_travelling_wind_2019b.slx\` and \`wheat_line_20_height_difference_wind_2019b.slx\`.

### Specific Scenarios
- **\`wheat_line_20_height_difference_wind_2019b.slx\`**: Simulates the effect of wind and height differences on wheat, allowing for the adjustment of proportions via parameters like alpha and beta.

### Utility Functions
- **\`set_wheat_params.m\`**: Sets various wheat parameters such as height, density, stiffness, damping, etc.
- **\`travelling_wind_verify.mlx\`**: Utility to plot and verify the traveling wind.

### Experiments with Sine Wind
- Various models and scripts specifically designed to run experiments using sine wind, such as \`run_wheat_field_sine_wind.m\`, \`run_wheat_field_sine_wind_random_height.m\`, and \`run_wheat_line_experiment.m\`.

## How to Use
You can run these models directly in MATLAB Simulink. Be sure to set the necessary parameters for your specific scenario. For further details on the functionality and usage of each file, refer to the comments within the scripts.
